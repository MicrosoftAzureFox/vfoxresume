# Setup

As you might expect, the first step to getting started with any new technology is setting up a couple of tools. While it is possible to create HTML and CSS with any text editor, using a code editor will offer features to make your life easier.

## Step 1: Create a repository and open it in github.dev

1. If you don't have a GitHub account, [join GitHub](https://github.com/join). Then, [create a new public repository](https://github.com/new) named **resume**. Make sure to select **Public** and to initialize the repository with a **README**.
1. Navigate to your new repository on GitHub.
1. Open the repository in github.dev by pressing the `.` key from the repository page, or swap `.com` with `.dev` in the URL. This will set up a [VS Code](code.visualstudio.com) environment in your browser.

## Step 2: Install CodeSwing

CodeSwing is an extension that helps you create HTML, CSS and JavaScript and see updates in real time.

1. Open the Extensions toolbar by selecting the **Extensions** icon from the Activity Bar on the left-hand side of your window. 
1. In the **Search Extensions** text box in the upper-right corner, type **CodeSwing**
1. Select **Install** for **CodeSwing**

The extension will be installed.

## Step 3: Turn on AutoSave

To turn on AutoSave, select the three parallel lines icon on the left-hand side of your github.dev window in the Activity Bar. Go to **File > AutoSave**. Your AutoSave is turned on if there is a check mark next to the AutoSave menu item. 

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You have the tools you need to begin creating HTML and CSS pages. Next, let's [create our first page](./1-create-html.md).
