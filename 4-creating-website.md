# Creating your website

Now that you have your basic resume crafted in [HTML](./create-html.md) and [CSS](./add-style.md), let's work on putting your resume on a website. To do this, we'll use a feature called GitHub Pages, which allows you to create a website directly from a repository on GitHub. 

âœ… Where's the best place to add your resume? GitHub, LinkedIn, your personal web site, or other?

## Commit your changes

The first thing we need to do is commit the changes we've made to our **resume** repository to GitHub. This will upload all of the resume content that we added to our repository, so we can use it for our website.

1. Select the **Source Control** icon on the left-hand side Activity Bar. There should be a small blue circle with a number inside, indicating the number of files you've made changes to since the last time you committed your code. 
1. Hover over the word **Changes**, and select the **+** button to Stage All Changes. All of the changes you stage will be committed. 
1. Write a message to go along with your commit.
1. Select the check mark icon at the top of the Source Control pane.

## Set up GitHub Pages

Next, turn on GitHub Pages for your **resume** repository.
1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub.com, and select **Settings**, next to the gear icon. 
1. Select **Pages** in the left-hand menu. 
1. Under **Source** select the **main** branch of your repository to be the source for your new website. Then, select **Save**.

1. After you select your source, you'll be notified of the address of your new website. It should look something like *your-username.github.io/resume/*. Navigate to the page, and check out your live resume website!

## Extra Credit!

Export your resume to a PDF file by saving it as a PDF from your browser's print functionality and uploading it to LinkedIn!
